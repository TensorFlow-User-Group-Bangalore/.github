TensorFlow User Groups (TFUGs) are communities of developers, engineers, data scientists, and ML practitioners who are passionate about TensorFlow and related technologies.

## What we're about

The meetups are composed of events around ML and TF to share best practices, discuss the future technology road-map, upcoming features, technology pitfalls and the entire gamut of Googleâ€™s TF related panoramic technology landscape.

Join our public Telegram group here: https://t.me/tfblr . This group will focus on general discussions around Machine Learning and TensorFlow. You are encouraged to join it. When you do so, don't forget to introduce yourself.

Mandatory disclaimer - TFUG Bangalore is an independent group; our activities and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to Google, the corporation. To learn more about the TFUG program, visit https://www.tensorflow.org/community
